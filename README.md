# Libmarkov

Implementations of [markov sentence generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators) in different languages.
> currently supports order-two generation

The goal of this project is to expose low-level and hackable generation apis that are simple to use. Each implementation will come with an api, as well as exectuables for the commandline that will work over stdin and stdout.

### Implementations
