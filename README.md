# Libmarkov

Implementations of [markov sentence generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators) in different languages.

The goal of this project is to expose low-level and hackable generation apis that are simple to use. Each implementation will be able to run from stdin as well as programmatically to cover a wide variety of use cases.

### Implementations
